# Set-PhillipsHue
**Work in progress** Windows PowerShell cmdlet to set the hue, brightness, saturation, effect, and power state of Phillips Hue light bulbs.  
  
Don't get too excited just yet because it's far from finished. After many hours of searching, I probably end up trying to implement [this](https://github.com/nstevens1040/Set-PhillipsHue/edit/main/README.md) in C#.  

Script assumes you've set a **PHILIPS_HUE_URI** environment variable to  
```http://<Hue Bridge Uri or IP Address>/api/<Philips Hue API Key>/lights```
