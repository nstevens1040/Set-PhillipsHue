# Set-PhillipsHue
**Work in progress** Windows PowerShell cmdlet to set the hue, brightness, saturation, effect, and power state of Phillips Hue light bulbs.  
  
Don't get too excited just yet because it's far from finished. After many hours of searching, I probably end up trying to implement [this](https://github.com/nstevens1040/Set-PhillipsHue/edit/main/README.md) in C#.
